# pySplit
Split Text Files on the Go!
**Problem:** 

Write a program split.py that splits a large file into multiple smaller files. The program should take a filename and the number of lines as arguments and write multiple small files each containing the specified number of lines (The last one may have smaller number of lines).

Usage
```$ python split.py files/100.txt 30
writing files/100-part1.txt
writing files/100-part2.txt
writing files/100-part3.txt
writing files/100-part4.txt
```
